## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React
A simple expense tracker built with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for initial folder structure and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for front-end. 

## Take Aways:

- Proper seperation of components
- Rendering & conditional rendering
- Lifting the state up
- Modal
- Higher order of components use for style
- Module css for separation of concerns
- Portal for backdrop and modal
